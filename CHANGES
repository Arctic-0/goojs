v0.10.0 --- 2014-05-20
======================

Additions:
 + Experimental way of clearing the engine using GooRunner.prototype.clear
 + Examples are linked to from jsdocs
 + Added Matrix4x4.prototype.getRotation

Fixes:
 * fix in Quaternion.prototype.fromVectorToVector

Breaking changes:
 * All debug related classes are relocated in the debugpack (MarkerComponent, CameraDebug, LightDebug, MeshRendererDebug, SkeletonDebug, CameraDebugSystem, DebugRenderSystem, LightDebugSystem, MarkerSystem, BoundingVolumeMeshBuilder, DebugDrawHelper, Debugger, EntityCounter, FrustumViewer, LightPointer)
 * New wave scripts (src/goo/scripts/newwave) are relocated to the parent folder, replacing some of the older scripts. The old FPCamControlScript, FlyControlScript, OrbitCamControlScript, OrbitNPanControlScript, MouseLookControlScript and WASDControlScript are thus replaced with new style scripts and are not backwards-compatible.
 - EntityUtils.createTypicalEntity has been removed as scheduled; use world.createEntity instead
 - EntityUtils.traverse has been removed as scheduled; use entity.traverse instead
 - ShapeCreator has been removed as scheduled; use new Box/Sphere/Quad... instead

v.0.9.10 --- 2014-05-14

v0.9.0 --- 2014-03-07
=====================

Additions:
 + added own sound system
 + added a lot of documentation

 + can now schedule callbacks to execute next frame from within a callback

Fixed:
 * various performance fixes
 * canvas resizing is stabilised if they have no style referring to dimensions

Changes:
 * major changes of the DynamicLoader API

Deprecated:
 - Material.createMaterial(); use new Material() instead


v0.8.0 --- 2014-02-10
=====================

Additions:
 + goo.js does not require that you use requirejs anymore; if requirejs is not detected when goo.js starts loading the it will automatically create a "goo" namespace and fill it with every class that the engine consists of
 + a new EntitySelection API
 + entities can now be tagged
 + entities can hold attributes
 + entity "selectors" based on id, name, system, components, tags and attributes

Changes:
 * goo.js is now split into a core goo.js (which is much smaller) and additional packs which provides extra functionality

Deprecated:
 - EntityUtils.traverse(); use entity.traverse() instead
 - EntityUtils.getChildren(); use entity.children.toArray() instead


v0.7.0 --- 2014-01-23
=====================

Additions:
 + Made engine IE compliant
 + Light cookies
 + More post effects: blur, hatch, HSV, noise
 + Added refraction to übershader
 + World fitted terrain script
 + Movement component
 + New shape: Cone
 + Systems can now be prioritized
 + Support for cloning entities with animations
 + Entities may preserve their world coordinates when attached/detached from a parent entity
 + Components may now inject methods in their host entities - TransformComponent injects its setTranslation, addTranslation, lookAt, setRotation, setScale, attachChild and detachChild
 + Correct handling of device pixel ratio
 + Automatic rescaling of RenderTargets for post effects when window scales
 + Added camera aspect ratio locking
 + Various fixes and performance improvements

Experimental additions:
 + Logic System
 + Beta support for AmmoComponent to add realistic physical behavior to entities
 + World has `add` method for adding entities/managers/systems and registering components
 + Entity has `set` method for adding/or modifying data supported by registered components

Changes:
 * Bounding boxes are now the default bounding volumes
 * Methods in Entity and World that did not return anything now return themselves to allow chaining
 * Tweaked default parameters of Lights, Camera and .lookAt

Deprecated:
 - EntityUtils.createTypicalEntity(); use world.createEntity() instead


v0.6.0 --- 2013-11-06
=====================

Added:
 + Fog
 + Global ambient
 + Opacity discard
 + Separate specularity
 + EntityUtils.hide / show
 + Handling of dual transparency
 + Support for custom start time and end time in animation clips
